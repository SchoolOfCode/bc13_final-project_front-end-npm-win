# Circles

Welcome to the Circles app, built in Next JS by [Danny Bains](https://github.com/DannyBains2), [Iona Meadows](https://github.com/ionajosephine), [Isabelle Francis](https://github.com/B2ella), [Camila Brizzi](https://github.com/sea-breezy), [Matt Doherty](https://github.com/matt190589/matt190589), Gabs. The following are instructions for how you can use this app, as a developer. 

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo, run:

```
npm i
```

then you should be able to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the homepage.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
